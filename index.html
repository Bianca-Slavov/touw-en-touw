      <h3>What is macramÃ©?</h3>
      <p>
        Macrame is a crafting technique that uses knots to create various
        textiles. Since this art form has regained popularity in recent years,
        crafters and artists are coming up with innovative ways to take macrame
        beyond the basic plant hangers and wall hangings.

      <h3>History of macramÃ©</h3>
      <p>
        The origin of MacramÃ© is generally attributed to Arabic weavers during
        the 13th century, using decorative knots to finish the loose ends of
        hand-woven textiles. However, decorative knot-tying can also be traced
        back to third-century China on ceremonial textiles as well as wall
        hangings. While it may be hard to pinpoint the very first MacramÃ© ever
        made, thanks to those 13th century Arabic Artisans the craft slowly
        spread throughout Europe and eventually became a common pastime for
        Sailors. Sailors played a large role in keeping MacramÃ© alive and
        sharing the art with new lands. Knots had many practical uses aboard
        their ships, but decorative knot-tying kept hands and minds occupied
        during long voyages. Furthermore, they would sell and barter their
        knotted goods such as hammocks, belts and hats at port. Knot-tying
        remained a popular hobby and way to adorn clothing and textiles through
        the Victorian era, when it fell mostly out of favor until it's wild and
        fabulous return in the 70's.
